# Gomoku AI Project

This project implements a Gomoku AI ("Brain") in C++ designed to communicate with the `liskvork` game manager. It also includes a Python visualizer for real-time game monitoring.

## Project Structure

- `src/main.cpp`: The C++ source code for your Gomoku AI.
- `Makefile`: Used to build the C++ AI.
- `pbrain-gomoku-ai`: The compiled executable of your AI.
- `liskvork-x86_64-linux-0.6.1`: The `liskvork` game manager (pre-compiled binary).
- `config.ini`: Configuration file for `liskvork`.
- `visualizer.py`: A Python script to visualize the game in real-time.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies (currently none beyond standard library).
- `board.log`: Log file generated by `liskvork` containing game states.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

-   **C++ Compiler**: `g++` (or compatible) for building the AI.
-   **make**: For using the Makefile.
-   **Python 3**: For running the visualizer. `tkinter` module (usually included with Python).

### Building Your AI

Navigate to the project root and compile your C++ AI:

```bash
make re
```
This will create an executable named `pbrain-gomoku-ai` in the project root.

### Configuring Liskvork

The `config.ini` file needs to be updated to tell `liskvork` where to find your AI. The provided setup assumes your AI executable (`pbrain-gomoku-ai`) is in the project root.

The `path` for `player1` and `player2` in `config.ini` should point to your compiled AI:

```ini
[player1]
path=./pbrain-gomoku-ai
[player2]
path=./pbrain-gomoku-ai
```

The `board_color` setting should be `false` for the visualizer to work correctly:

```ini
[log]
board_file=./board.log
board_color=false
```

These changes have already been applied by the AI.

## Running the Game

To run a game between two instances of your AI using `liskvork`:

1.  **Start `liskvork` (Manager)**:
    It's recommended to clear the `board.log` file before each new game to avoid mixing logs from different sessions.

    ```bash
    rm -f board.log && ./liskvork-x86_64-linux-0.6.1
    ```
    If `liskvork-x86_64-linux-0.6.1` is not executable, run `chmod +x ./liskvork-x86_64-linux-0.6.1` first.

2.  **Start the Visualizer**:
    In a separate terminal, navigate to the project root and run the Python visualizer:

    ```bash
    python3 visualizer.py
    ```

    The visualizer window will appear, displaying the game in real-time. You can use the "Live (Auto-follow)" checkbox to toggle between real-time updates and manual navigation through game history using the "Prev", "Next" buttons, or the slider.

## Debugging Tips

-   The `board.log` file is continuously updated by `liskvork`.
-   Your C++ AI can send debug messages using `std::cout << "DEBUG Your message" << std::endl;`. These messages will appear in the terminal where `liskvork` is running.
-   Use the visualizer's replay features (`Prev`, `Next`, slider) to analyze specific moves or game states.
